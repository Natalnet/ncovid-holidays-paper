## Project Language

- Python 3
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

## Folder structure and Code

The main code is divided in three files (folder `notebooks/`):

- Holiday - passo 1 - SEIRD Model.ipynb
- Holiday - passo 2 - Data Analysis SEIRD and Mobility.ipynb
- Holiday - passo 3 - Regression.ipynb

Also, all dataset that were used are in `dbs/` and `dbs/handled/`:

- dbs/handled/*
- brasil_df.csv
- cases-brazil-states.csv
- mobility_report_brazil.csv


## Results

Curves of selected settings: Conf.1: Cases, that is, our baseline case; considering which parameters can improve the baseline case, we select Conf.3: Cases + R0; without using Cases as an input feature, we select Conf.9: R0 + Re + Holiday flag, and; Conf.10: PC1 + PC2 as input data. 

(a) COVID-19 daily deaths forecast using cases as input data.

(b) COVID-19 daily deaths forecasts using Cases + R0 as input data. 

(c) COVID-19 daily deaths forecasts using R0 + Re + Holiday flag as input data. 

(d) COVID-19 daily deaths forecasts using PC1 + PC2 as input data.

For these configurations, we draw the best curves (with the lowest RMSE) of each configuration over the test data.

          ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we investigate the influence of holidays and community mobility on the transmission rate and death count of COVID-19 in Brazil. We identify national holidays and hallmark holidays to assess their effect on disease reports of confirmed cases and deaths. First, we use a one-variate model with the number of infected people as input data to forecast the number of deaths. This simple model is compared with a more robust deep learning multi-variate model that uses mobility and transmission rates (R0, Re) from a SEIRD model as input data. A principal components model of community mobility, generated by the principal component analysis (PCA) method, is added to improve the input features for the multi-variate model. The deep learning model architecture is an LSTM stacked layer combined with a dense layer to regress daily deaths caused by COVID-19. The multi-variate model incremented with engineered input features can enhance the forecast performance by up to 18.99% compared to the standard one-variate data-driven model.},

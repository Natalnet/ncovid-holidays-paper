# National Holidays and Social Mobility Behaviors: Alternatives for Forecasting COVID-19 Deaths in Brazil
## Code and data repository

The main code is on [final_file_forecast_SPSP.ipynb](final_file_forecast_SPSP.ipynb). The data used to train the models is on file [df_spsp_pred.csv](df_spsp_pred.csv). Folder [experiments](experiments) contains all files (models and errors) used to generate the plots presented in the paper. Some of the files names are in portuguese, so a quick translation is: mortes (Deaths), casos (Cases), temperatura (Temperature). Experiment [casos-aqi-temp-humid_mortes](experiments/casos-aqi-temp-humid_mortes) wasn't added to the paper due to poor performance.
